        <h1>Earth</h1>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the sun and the only planet known to support life. It has a unique combination of atmospheric conditions, liquid water, and a magnetic field that create an environment suitable for a wide range of organisms. Roughly 71% of Earth's surface is covered in water, with vast oceans playing a crucial role in regulating temperature and weather patterns. The remaining 29% is land, made up of continents and islands that host a variety of ecosystems, from rainforests to deserts.</p>
